    <ol>
        
        <li><b>Ingredients:</b></li>
            <ol>
                
                <li>21/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>21/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            </ol>
        <li><b>Instructions:</b></li>
            <OL>
                <li>Preheat the Oven:
                    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
                <li>
                    Sift Dry Ingredients:
                    In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Sifting helps to aerate the dry ingredients and ensures a smoother batter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cream Butter and Sugar:
                    In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done with a hand mixer or a stand mixer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Eggs:
                    Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Vanilla Extract:
                    Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined. This adds a delightful flavor to the cake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternate Dry Ingredients and Milk:
                    Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Overmixing can result in a dense cake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour Batter into Pans:
                    Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake:
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The exact time may vary, so start checking around 25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cool:
                    Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Frosting (Optional):
                    Once the cakes are completely cool, you can frost them with your favorite icing or frosting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enjoy:
                    Slice and enjoy your homemade cake!
